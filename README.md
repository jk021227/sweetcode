# 🌟 Welcome to Sweetcode! 🌟

## 🎨 Inspiration
We were inspired by the challenge of making complex data structures and algorithms more relatable and fun, especially for the youth and fellow girlie and non-binary pops who feel intimidated by the scary interface of Leetcode and other technical interviewing tools. We wanted to create an engaging way for learners to grasp these concepts, so we infused storytelling into our project. This is our gateway for fixing the leaky faucet of our allies who don't feel like they belong in Computer Science. 🚀💖

## 🛠️ What it does
Sweetcode is our creative take on gamifying computer science concepts for the youth to increase diversity in tech! In our interactive world, players help villagers in Tree Town organize their ancient scrolls, all while solving challenges related to Binary Trees 🌳, AVL Trees 🌲, and Red-Black Trees 🔴⚫. We also added an **Interview Isle** where you can practice learned concepts with feedback! 📚✨

## 🏗️ How we built it
We built Sweetcode using **Python** with **Flask** for the backend, and for the frontend, we used **React** with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. Our goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that enhances the learning experience. We also integrated the **OpenAI API** for Interview Isle and drew all the assets ourselves! 🎨🖌️

## ⚡ Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was finding the right balance between the complexity of computer science concepts and making the narrative engaging. We also faced hurdles in maintaining interactive elements while ensuring our UI remained responsive. 😅💪

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re incredibly proud of how we blended educational content with a captivating adventure story! It feels rewarding to know we’ve made complex topics more accessible and enjoyable for learners. 🌈🙌

## 📚 What we learned
Through this project, we learned a lot about creating interactive educational platforms and designing user-friendly interfaces with Tailwind CSS, React, and Flask. We also discovered the importance of storytelling in education and tailoring user experiences to the people who need them most. 🌍❤️

## 🌍 What's next for Sweetcode
Looking ahead, we plan to expand our adventure to new regions like **Graph Grove** 🌳, introduce multiplayer features 🎮, and include even more complex algorithms to challenge our advanced learners. We're excited about the future of Sweetcode! 🚀🌟
