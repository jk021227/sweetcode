# **Sweetcode Adventure: CS Concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms**

## **Region 1: Data Structures Region**


### 1. Timberland Forest (Tree Town)
**Concepts:** Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees

**Story:** Deep in Timberland Forest, the villagers need your help! The enchanted trees that store their ancient scrolls have become chaotic, making it impossible to find the right scroll. The forest keeper, an old wise owl, is in charge of balancing the trees and keeping order.

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The wise owl has scattered scrolls across Timberland Forest, but they need to be properly stored. Help the owl organize the scrolls in a **Binary Search Tree** by inserting the following scrolls in order: `50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80`. Which scroll goes where?
   
2. The **Red-Black Tree** in the village is glowing red! The villagers can’t figure out why it’s keeping balance so well. Can you explain the difference between the **AVL Tree** and the **Red-Black Tree** to help them understand?

3. One of the villagers has lost a special scroll somewhere in the **Binary Search Tree**. Write a function to help them find the scroll with the value 60, so they can restore peace in the forest.


### 2. Array Archipelago (Array Town)
**Concepts:** 1D Arrays, 2D Arrays, Dynamic Arrays

**Story:** In the Array Archipelago, the villagers store magical artifacts in containers, but they’ve run into a problem—their rigid containers can’t hold more than they’re supposed to! You’ve been summoned to help them by using dynamic containers that can expand when necessary.

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. Oh no! There are three islands in the archipelago, each with a collection of magical artifacts. Help the villagers organize the items `["wood", "stone", "iron"]` into a **1D array** so that each island has its resources perfectly stored.
   
2. One of the islands has multiple layers, and the villagers need to create a **2D array** to represent all the items stored in each layer. Write a function to store the layers of resources.

3. The villagers have just discovered a new artifact, but their container isn’t big enough. Help them by creating a **dynamic array** that can grow and shrink as needed, and write a function to search for any specific item in the array.


### 3. Graph Grove (Graph Town)
**Concepts:** Graphs, Adjacency Lists, Adjacency Matrices

**Story:** The magical vines of Graph Grove connect every village through mystical paths. Some of these paths are one-way, and others are two-way roads! The villagers need you to navigate these tangled connections to find their way through the enchanted forest.

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The village council needs a map of all their villages and roads. Using the roads they gave you, create a **graph** to show the connections between villages.

2. Oh no! The enchanted paths are fading, and the villagers don’t know if they’re represented correctly. Compare the **adjacency list** and **adjacency matrix** representations to figure out which one is more useful to restore the paths.

3. A wandering merchant is lost and needs help! Write a function to check if there’s a path between the Merchant’s Lodge and the Wizard’s Tower using the connections in the **graph**.


### 4. Hashville (Hashing Town)
**Concepts:** Hash Maps, Hash Tables, Hash Functions, Collision Resolution

**Story:** The residents of Hashville use magical keys to access treasure chests, but lately, there’s been trouble—sometimes two keys open the same chest, and no one knows why! Help the villagers figure out how to handle these "collisions" so each treasure can be accessed properly.

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The village elder has misplaced the keys to some important treasures! Help him organize the treasures in a **HashMap** by inserting the following key-value pairs: `("apple", 1), ("banana", 2), ("orange", 3)`. Which key opens which chest?

2. The elder is having trouble understanding how the magic keys work. Explain to the villagers how the **hash function** helps find the right chest and what makes a good hash function.

3. Two villagers just tried to open the same chest with different keys! Use **chaining** to resolve the collision and ensure both villagers can get their treasures. Write a function that handles this problem.

## **Region 2: Algorithms Region**

### 1. Sorting Savanna (Sorting Town)
**Concepts:** Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

**Story:** In Sorting Savanna, magical piles of enchanted gems need to be sorted so that they can harness their powers properly. Each pile has different properties, and the villagers need your help using the right sorting ritual to put them in order.

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The piles of gems are a mess! Use the ancient **Bubble Sort** ritual to organize the gems in this pile: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`. Can you help the villagers sort them by power?

2. The **Merge Sort** priestess needs help explaining her magical sorting technique to the villagers. Break it down and explain how **Merge Sort** works and its magical efficiency.

3. The Quick Sort Wizard has chosen a gem as a **pivot**, but the villagers are confused. Write a function to perform **Quick Sort** on the villagers' pile of gems and ensure the most powerful gems are at the top.

### 2. Pathfinding Prairie (Search Algorithms Town)
**Concepts:** Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm

**Story:** In Pathfinding Prairie, travelers are always looking for the shortest or most efficient paths through the vast landscape. Some explore deeply into unknown territory, while others take it step by step. Villagers need your help to find the fastest way to their destination!

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The prairie explorers need to map out their path through the plains. Perform a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** on the map starting from the Explorer’s Camp and mark the explored paths.

2. Some of the explorers want to take a more cautious approach and explore level by level. Explain the difference between **DFS** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and which method should be used in this scenario.

3. The villagers have found a magical compass! Help them use **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the shortest path from the Camp to the Mountain Summit, and write a function that plots the shortest route.



### 3. Recursion Ridge (Recursion Town)
**Concepts:** Recursion, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer

**Story:** In Recursion Ridge, villagers solve their problems by breaking them down into smaller, easier steps. However, sometimes they get stuck in endless loops and need your help to find their way back. You’re the hero who can solve their recursive dilemmas!

**Yassified Sample Questions:**
1. The villagers need to perform a ritual to calculate the **factorial** of a number, but they can’t figure out how to do it recursively. Write a function that calculates the factorial of any number to help them complete the ritual.

2. The village queen is trying to place magical queens on a chessboard, but there are too many possibilities. Explain how **backtracking** helps solve the N-Queens problem and demonstrate the technique to her.

3. The villagers found a giant array of treasures, but they need to split it into smaller, more manageable piles. Use **Divide and Conquer** to write a function that helps them find the largest treasure in the pile.
