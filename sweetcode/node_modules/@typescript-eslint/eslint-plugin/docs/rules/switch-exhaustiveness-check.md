When working with union types in TypeScript, it's common to want to write a `switch` statement intended to contain a `case` for each constituent (possible type in the union).
However, if the union type changes, it's easy to forget to modify the cases to account for any new types.

This rule reports when a `switch` statement over a value typed as a union of literals is missing a case for any of those literal types and does not have a `default` clause.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect
=======
# Exhaustiveness checking in switch with union type (`switch-exhaustiveness-check`)

Union type may have a lot of parts. It's easy to forget to consider all cases in switch. This rule reminds which parts are missing. If domain of the problem requires to have only a partial switch, developer may _explicitly_ add a default clause.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
>>>>>>> 8aded176e2bf64ab331edd712b5a251ef6940ffa

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
}
```

### ✅ Correct
=======
  case 'Monday': {
    result = 1;
    break;
  }
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:
>>>>>>> 8aded176e2bf64ab331edd712b5a251ef6940ffa

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  case 'Tuesday':
    result = 2;
    break;
  case 'Wednesday':
    result = 3;
    break;
  case 'Thursday':
    result = 4;
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    result = 5;
    break;
  case 'Saturday':
    result = 6;
    break;
  case 'Sunday':
    result = 7;
    break;
}
```

### ✅ Correct
=======
  case 'Monday': {
    result = 1;
    break;
  }
  case 'Tuesday': {
    result = 2;
    break;
  }
  case 'Wednesday': {
    result = 3;
    break;
  }
  case 'Thursday': {
    result = 4;
    break;
  }
  case 'Friday': {
    result = 5;
    break;
  }
  case 'Saturday': {
    result = 6;
    break;
  }
  case 'Sunday': {
    result = 7;
    break;
  }
}

}
```

## When Not To Use It

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you don't frequently `switch` over union types with many parts, or intentionally wish to leave out some parts.
=======
If program doesn't have union types with many parts. Downside of this rule is the need for type information, so it's slower than regular rules.
