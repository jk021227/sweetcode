Some TypeScript applications store literal values on classes using fields with the `readonly` modifier to prevent them from being reassigned.
When writing TypeScript libraries that could be used by JavaScript users, however, it's typically safer to expose these literals using `getter`s, since the `readonly` modifier is enforced at compile type.

# Ensures that literals on classes are exposed in a consistent style (`class-literal-property-style`)

When writing TypeScript applications, it's typically safe to store literal values on classes using fields with the `readonly` modifier to prevent them from being reassigned.
When writing TypeScript libraries that could be used by JavaScript users however, it's typically safer to expose these literals using `getter`s, since the `readonly` modifier is enforced at compile type.

## Rule Details
>>>>>>> 8aded176e2bf64ab331edd712b5a251ef6940ffa

This rule aims to ensure that literals exposed by classes are done so consistently, in one of the two style described above.
By default this rule prefers the `fields` style as it means JS doesn't have to setup & teardown a function closure.

## Options

:::note

This rule only checks for constant _literal_ values (string, template string, number, bigint, boolean, regexp, null). It does not check objects or arrays, because a readonly field behaves differently to a getter in those cases. It also does not check functions, as it is a common pattern to use readonly fields with arrow function values as auto-bound methods.
This is because these types can be mutated and carry with them more complex implications about their usage.

:::

### `"fields"`

This style checks for any getter methods that return literal values, and requires them to be defined using fields with the `readonly` modifier instead.

Examples of code with the `fields` style:

<!--tabs-->

#### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/class-literal-property-style: ["error", "fields"] */

class Mx {
  public static get myField1() {
    return 1;
  }

  private get ['myField2']() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
}
```

### The `fields` style

This style checks for any getter methods that return literal values, and requires them to be defined using fields with the `readonly` modifier instead.

Examples of **correct** code with the `fields` style:
>>>>>>> 8aded176e2bf64ab331edd712b5a251ef6940ffa

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/class-literal-property-style: ["error", "fields"] */

class Mx {
  public readonly myField1 = 1;

  // not a literal
  public readonly myField2 = [1, 2, 3];

  private readonly ['myField3'] = 'hello world';

  public get myField4() {
    return `hello from ${window.location.href}`;
  }
}

### `"getters"`

Examples of **incorrect** code with the `fields` style:

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/class-literal-property-style: ["error", "fields"] */

class Mx {
  public static get myField1() {
    return 1;
  }

  private get ['myField2']() {
    return 'hello world';
  }
}
```

### The `getters` style
>>>>>>> 8aded176e2bf64ab331edd712b5a251ef6940ffa

This style checks for any `readonly` fields that are assigned literal values, and requires them to be defined as getters instead.
This style pairs well with the [`@typescript-eslint/prefer-readonly`](prefer-readonly.md) rule,
as it will identify fields that can be `readonly`, and thus should be made into getters.

## When Not To Use It

When you have no strong preference, or do not wish to enforce a particular style
for how literal values are exposed by your classes.
